Visual Studio configuration for C# 


Paths and Gurobi version may vary depending on your configuration.

<project> -> References -> Add Reference -> /gurobi701/win64/bin/Gurobi70.NET.dll

<project> -> Properties -> Build -> Platform target: x64

(or else one may get System.BadImageFormatException)


old instructions:
Add to Environment Variable "Path": /gurobi701/win64/bin
(needed to find gurobi70.dll at runtime)
